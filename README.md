The main idea of the project is to give a completely interactive
experience to the user, creating a game that is divided in two
different level: one more complex than the other. The difficulty is
characterized by the movement of the hero that is more slowed
down than the movement in the first level. The user, for each level,
will recover 5 elements to go to next level and to complete the
game. For the realization of this project JavaScript, HTML, CSS and
